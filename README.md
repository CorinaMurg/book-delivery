This is the first comprehensive React site that I designed and developed after completing the 
Scrimba's Advanced React course and Packt's React the Complete Guide.

ðŸ“š TWAIN AND COMPANY 
A bookstore app built in React. 

General architecture of the site
1. Design and development of the front page of the site:
- header, footer, delivery info, list of books with title, author and price info
- shopping cart feature that allows customers to add books to their cart
- a modal for the shopping cart with checkout form, form validation, saving cart data to Firebase. It also 
features buttons for adjusting the quantity for each book. 
2. Create the Firebase backend:
- Realtime Database for the json object containing all the books (right now only 8 books are being displayed)
- Storage for the book covers
3. Responsive design
4. Accessibility features (caveat: not available yet for cart modal)
5. Deployed to Netlify

Things to tweak:
- style modal for mobile
- hover style for header cart!!!!!!!
- center book list for tablet view
- change font style + letter spacing
- change style of header cart button
- local storage for cart (until user account feature is added)
- change style of cart
- a11y for cart/modal
- add social icons to footer
- adjust for longer titles/author name
- FOOTER IS BORING. DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
