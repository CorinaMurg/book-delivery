This is the first comprehensive React site that I designed and developed after completting the Scrimba's Advanced React course and Packt's React the Complete Guide.

Part 1: General architecture of the site
1. Desing and develop the front page of the site:
- header, footer, delivery info, list of books with title, author and price info
- a modal for the shopping cart with adding/removing books to the cart, checkout form, form validation, saving cart data to Firebase
2. Create the Firebase backend:
- Realtime Database for the json object containing all the books (right now only 8 books are being displayed)
- Storage for the book covers
3. Responsiveness
4. Accessibility


Part 2: Add search + filter features
1. Search bar
2. Filter books by certain criteria
3. Display individual pages for each book 
4. Add subscribe feature to footer


Part 3: Add inventory data to Firebase

Part 4: Add Customer account + login
