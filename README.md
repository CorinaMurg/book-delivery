This is the first comprehensive React site that I designed and developed after completting the 
Scrimba's Advanced React course and Packt's React the Complete Guide.

ðŸ“š TWAIN AND COMPANY 
A bookstore app built in React. 

Part 1: General architecture of the site
1. Design and develop the front page of the site:
- header, footer, delivery info, list of books with title, author and price info
- shopping cart feature that allows customers to add books to their cart
- a modal for the shopping cart with checkout form, form validation, saving cart data to Firebase. It also 
features buttons for adjusting the quantity for each book. 
2. Create the Firebase backend:
- Realtime Database for the json object containing all the books (right now only 8 books are being displayed)
- Storage for the book covers
3. Responsive design
4. Accessibility features (caveat: not available yet for cart modal)
5. Deployed to Netlify

Possible Improvements:
- change font style + letter spacing
- local storage for cart (until user account feature is added)
- change style of cart
- a11y for cart/modal
- add social icons to footer


Part 2: Add search + filter features
1. Search bar
2. Filter books by certain criteria
3. Display individual pages for each book 
4. Add subscribe feature to footer


Part 3: Add inventory data to Firebase
1. Alert customers when inventory is low
2. Display out-of-stock when inventory=0

Part 4: Add Customer account + login
1. Allow customers to create account with profile, save favorite items, and past orders
